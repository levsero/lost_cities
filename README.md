### Rules

For the rules of the game click [here](http://www.happymeeple.com/en/board-games/lost-cities/rules/)

### Implementation

To properly implement the game it would require a server and the players to be on seperate computers, being that this is only a single static page the game is not for competitive play.

Starts as player1's turn. Left click to play card, right click to discard card. The game ends when all the middle pile reaches 0.

### TODO

* Pick from discard piles.
* Modal of rules.
* New game button.
* End of game message and score.
